# Train-pentograph
This C++ project demonstrates how to control a servo motor to simulate the actuation of a train pantograph using an Arduino. The servo motor will sweep from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and back to 0 degrees, mimicking the motion of raising and lowering a train p

## Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo motor
- Connecting wires
- External power source (if needed for the servo motor)

## Circuit Diagram
- Connect the ground (GND) of the servo motor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
- Connect the VCC of the servo motor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- Connect the signal pin of the servo motor to digital pin 9 on the Arduino.-
